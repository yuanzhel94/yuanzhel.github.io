I am a final year PhD student in the [Systems Lab](https://www.sysneuro.org/) at The University of Melbourne, under the supervision of Andrew Zalesky, Caio Seguin, and Maria Di Biase. 

My work studies the human brain in health and disease, with neuroimages and machine learning. I build generative and normative models to understand the evolution, development, and aging of the human brain anatomy, structure, and funciton. I also develop statistical tools for brain research.
